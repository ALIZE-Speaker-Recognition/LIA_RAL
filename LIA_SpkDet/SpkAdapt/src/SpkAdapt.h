// The LIA team as well as the ALIZE project want to highlight the limits of voice authentication
// in a forensic context. 
// The following paper proposes a good overview of this point:
// [Bonastre J.F., Bimbot F., Boe L.J., Campbell J.P., Douglas D.A., Magrin-chagnolleau I.,
//  Person  Authentification by Voice: A Need of Caution,
//  Eurospeech 2003, Genova]
// The conclusion of the paper of the paper is proposed bellow:
// [Currently, it is not possible to completely determine whether the
//  similarity between two recordings is due to the speaker or to other
//  factors, especially when: (a) the speaker does not cooperate, (b) there
//  is no control over recording equipment, (c) recording conditions are not 
//  known, (d) one does not know whether the voice was disguised and, to a
//  lesser extent, (e) the linguistic content of the message is not
//  controlled. Caution and judgment must be exercised when applying speaker
//  recognition techniques, whether human or automatic, to account for these
//  uncontrolled factors. Under more constrained or calibrated situations,
//  or as an aid for investigative purposes, judicious application of these
//  techniques may be suitable, provided they are not considered as infallible.
//  At the present time, there is no scientific process that enables one to
//  uniquely characterize a person=92s voice or to identify with absolute
//  certainty an individual from his or her voice.]
