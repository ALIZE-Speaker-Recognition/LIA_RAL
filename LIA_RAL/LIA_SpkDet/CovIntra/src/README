For eigenvalue decomposition:
Download SVDLIBC.
Compile with svdlibc.Makefile, ie go into SVDLIBC dir and
make -f ../svdlibc.Makefile

Check that you have what is needed in the src dir:
svdlib.h
libsvd.a

For convenience, we have included compiled SVDLIBC as
libsvd.a in the src folder. This is the 1.34 V, downloaded
from http://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/SVDLIBC/.

Note this version of libsvd.a is compiled under ubuntu. Error
messages can occurs for compilation under Windows or other
systems.
