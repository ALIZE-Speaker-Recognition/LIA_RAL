LIA_RAL Package: v2
###### GNU/GPL Licence v2 and higher ################
News:
----
Channel Compensation techniques have been integrated (Factor Analysis model, NAP).
Use of SVM classifier is now possible with linear kernels, and GMM supervectors.
*** Requirements: 
	- SVM: libsvm http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/ see README file in SVM directory
	- SVDLIBC: to perform a SVD for NAP, http://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/SVDLIBC/, see README file in CovIntra directory
Make is still recursive, but the best way to compile is to go into one app directory and then type make


News:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New architecture. The package LIA_RAL (LIA_SpkTools library) is compulsory in order to use the LIA system. Please download it.
The whole LIA_RAL package has been cut into three distinct packages to download depending on your needs:
- LIA_SpkDet: Speaker detection (Id, verification, tracking,...)
- LIA_Seg: To work on speaker diarization
- LIA_Utils: Small but useful utilities
Please download one or all the packages and place them into the LIA_RAL directory.
If you're working with only one package, please edit the makefile and comment the lines mentionning the packages you are not using.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Features:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frame Pruning: Morphological filter, Channel overlapping pruning
Segmental Processing; Label File based processing, Segmental LLR computation, normalization, decision
Feature mapping
Multiple models processing: GMM models by label
Frame weighting for LLR computation
Mutliple weighting funcions for fusion
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Contents
-----------

Utilities for Automatic Speaker Recognition developed by the LIA.
All of them are based on the ALIZE platform:
http://www.lia.univ-avignon.fr/heberges/ALIZE/
See `foo --help`, for help on each program.
cfg/ directory gives you some configuration files foo.cfg for almost each program. 


II. Install
-----------

1. sh install.sh 
2. Fill in the config.txt file with your own parameters
3. 	For a FULL install, proceed as the following by typing this in a shell:
		make 
		make install
	For a PARTIAL install, say you only want to install TrainWorld:
		cd LIA_SpkDet/TrainWord
		make
		make install (only install TrainWorld)
		(make clean only clean this directory, make cleanlib clean libliatools)
		

To compile in debug mode:
	make clean
	make DEBUG=yes
	make DEBUG=yes install
	

The makefile system is recursive meaning you can do a complete make anywhere in the architecture by typing make, this will bring you to the package root and perform a complete make.

A 'make tags' will generate a lia_ral.tags file in your TAGS_DIR directory via the TAGS program (both have to be set in config.txt). ctags is the typical program to generate tags when using vi, etags is for emacs.

III. Maintain
-------------

To add you own application:
1. Create a new directory in LIA_SpkDet or LIA_Seg, the name of the directory will be the name of your application.
2. Sub-directories and files has to placed exactly in the same way as in the other directories (source files placed in src/ is compulsory).
3. Copy a Makefile of another directory into your own.
4. Copy a Makefile of another src sub-directory into your own.
4. In a shell:
	make install

That's it!

IV. Misc.
---------

-IV.1 Usefull commands

How to clean like Mr Proper
	make dist-clean
This will remove .depend files, objs directories, execs.

How to create an archive:
	make distrib
This will remove .depend files, CVS, execs and objs directories to make a proper package.

-IV.2 Doc generation

How to generate docs:
	make docs
This will invoke pdflatex to generate pdf docs in LIA_RAL/doc

How to generate doxygen:
	make doxygen
This will invoke doxygen to generate HTML docs in LIA_RAL/doc/doxygen. 

Caution :
1. Don't forget to modify the 2 INPUT parameters fields of the doxygen.cfg file. 
   Those lines must be filled with correct path to your LIA_RAL folder. 
2. pdflatex and doxygen software must be installed to invoke docs and doxygen make commands

V. CVS
-------
An external CVS for ALIZE is not yet available. Soon.... 

V. Bugs & Known Problems
-------
- You probably have to do make clean sometimes after an error or after updating ALIZE and LIA_TOOLS libraries.
- You have to do a make clean if you invoke make DEBUG=yes
- You have to do a make clean if you update alize lib.

- Any questions; mail the alize-devel list (see the ALIZE website)
